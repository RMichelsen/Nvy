# Nvy

Nvy is a minimal [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) client for Windows written in C++.
It uses DirectWrite to shape and render the grid cells and text.\
Since Nvy is just a front-end for Neovim, installing Neovim is required to use Nvy, preferably the
latest nightly version from [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases).

## Configuration

Nvy sets the global vim variable `g:nvy = 1` in case you want to specialize your init.vim while using Nvy.

Fonts can be changed by setting the guifont in `init.vim`, for example:
`set guifont=Fira\ Code:h24`. <br>
Note: you have to specify the font size, e.g. `set guifont=Fira\ Code` won't work. <br>
A fallback font can be specified by appending it, e.g. `set guifont=Fira\ Code:h24:Consolas` to set Consolas as the fallback font.

Nvy can be started with the following flags:
- `--maximize` to start in maximized
- `--fullscreen` to start in fullscreen
- `--position=<x>,<y>` to start with a given position, e.g. `--position=500,200`
- `--geometry=<cols>x<rows>` to start with a given number of rows and columns, e.g. `--geometry=80x25`
- `--disable-ligatures` to disable font ligatures
- `--disable-fullscreen` to disable toggling fullscreen with Alt+Enter
- `--linespace-factor=<float>` to scale the line spacing by a floating point factor, e.g. `--linespace-factor=1.2`

## Extra Features

- You can use Alt+Enter to toggle fullscreen
- You can use Ctrl+Mousewheel to zoom
- You can drag files onto Nvy to open them (:e)
- Dragging files while holding Ctrl opens them in a new window (:new)

## Build

### Requirements

- A compiler supporting `C++20`
- [The latest Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)

Apart from the Windows SDK, the only dependency Nvy uses is the excellent [MPack](https://github.com/ludocode/mpack) library
which is compiled alongside the client itself.

### Build example with [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RMichelsen/Nvy.git
cd Nvy
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -GNinja
ninja
```
